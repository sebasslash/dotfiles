## Welcome to my dotfiles

I'll be periodically updating this, however it's really just for me in case my computer catches fire. I'm open for any modifications, just submit a pull request detailing how my *crappy* dot configs can be done better. 

### What's on the Horizon
* Properly symlink my *real* dotfiles to this repo, so updates are automatic (right now these files are just a copy *gasp*)
* Get coc.nvim to fully work (that's really only just for me)
* Maybe make a shell script that will install all these files automatically?
